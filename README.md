# House Price Prediction Project

This project implements a machine learning model for predicting house prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area, lot area, and other factors. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about houses in a specific area.

## Features

- Predicts house prices based on multiple features.
- Uses a machine learning model trained on historical data.
- Provides accurate price estimates for houses in the given area.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MOHINI1403/house-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask application:

   ```
   python deploy.py
   ```

4. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

5. Enter the relevant features for a house and click "Predict" to get the estimated price.
